## Report a vulnerability

Do not include secrets, private Storybook URLs, customer source, or screenshots in a public issue.

## Data boundary

The addon is manager-only and performs no background network requests. It does not collect, persist, or transmit story source, DOM, screenshots, args, parameters, metadata, or analytics. Clipboard writes and external navigation require an explicit user click.
